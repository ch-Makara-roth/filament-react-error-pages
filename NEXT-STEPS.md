# Next Steps: Completing Your Laravel Package with React and Filament

You've successfully created the basic structure for your Laravel package with React (TSX) and Filament support. Here are the next steps to complete the setup and use the package:

## 1. Prerequisites Setup

Since PHP is not installed on your system, you'll need to set up the PHP development environment first. Please refer to the `SETUP-PREREQUISITES.md` file for detailed instructions on:

- Installing PHP
- Installing Composer
- Setting up a Laravel project
- Installing Filament

## 2. Building the React Components

To build the React components in your package:

```bash
# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Build the React components
npm run build
```

This will compile the TypeScript/TSX files into JavaScript and generate the necessary distribution files in the `dist` directory.

## 3. Testing in a Laravel Project

To test your package in a Laravel project:

### Option 1: Develop within an existing Laravel project

1. Create a new Laravel project if you don't have one:

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel test-project
cd test-project
```

2. Update the Laravel project's `composer.json` to include your package as a local repository:

```json
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "path",
        "url": "../path/to/your/package"
    }
],
"require": {
    "makararoth/filament-react-error-pages": "*",
    ...
}
```

3. Install the package:

```bash
composer update
```

### Option 2: Publish your package

1. Create a GitHub repository and push your package
2. Install it in your Laravel project using Composer:

```bash
composer require makararoth/filament-react-error-pages
```

## 4. Configuring the Package in Your Laravel Project

1. Publish the package configuration:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-react-error-pages-config
```

2. Publish the package assets:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-react-error-pages-assets
```

3. Configure the package in `config/filament-react-error-pages.php`

## 5. Integrating with Filament

If you're using Filament, make sure to:

1. Register your package's resources with Filament in the service provider
2. Add any custom Filament pages or resources
3. Test that error pages appear correctly within the Filament UI

## 6. Customizing Error Pages

You can customize the error pages by:

1. Creating your own React components
2. Registering them in the config file:

```php
// config/filament-react-error-pages.php
'error_components' => [
    404 => 'YourCustomNotFoundComponent',
    500 => 'YourCustomServerErrorComponent',
],
```

## 7. Package Enhancements

Consider adding these enhancements to your package:

- Add more error page components (401, 403, etc.)
- Create additional tests
- Add more Filament-specific integrations
- Add internationalization (i18n) support
- Create a demo/preview mode

## 8. Documentation

Expand the documentation:

- Add more examples
- Create a demo video
- Add screenshots of the error pages

## Congratulations!

You've created a Laravel package that integrates React components with Filament support. This package provides a great starting point for creating custom error pages in Laravel applications.
